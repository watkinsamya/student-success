ðŸŽ“ Student Grades & Academic Success Predictor
ðŸ“Œ Overview
The Student Success Predictor is a Streamlit-based web application designed to help educators, students, and academic advisors predict academic risk levels and final grades using machine learning models.
It uses two datasets:

Kaggle StudentsPerformance (classification: At-Risk / Average / High)

UCI Student Performance (regression: Predict final grade G3 on a 0â€“20 scale)

This tool provides early alerts to identify at-risk students and offers data-driven insights to improve student success.

ðŸš€ Features
Risk Category Prediction: Classifies students into performance categories using demographic and exam data.

Final Grade Prediction: Predicts a studentâ€™s final G3 grade based on prior grades, absences, and lifestyle factors.

Interactive UI: Simple, user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit.

Pre-trained Models: Models are already trained and saved in the models/ folder for instant use.

ðŸ§  Machine Learning Models
Two models are included:

Kaggle Classifier â€” Uses a pipeline with preprocessing and a classification algorithm to predict risk category.

UCI Regressor â€” Uses Gradient Boosting (best performer) to predict final G3 grade.

Performance Metrics (lower MAE/RMSE = better, higher RÂ² = better):

Model	MAE	RMSE	RÂ²
Gradient Boosting	1.02	1.69	0.855
Decision Tree	1.03	1.73	0.848
KNN	1.16	1.78	0.840
Linear Regression	1.21	1.94	0.816



ðŸ’¡ Future Improvements
Add personalized study recommendations.

Enable CSV bulk uploads for batch predictions.

Integrate visualization dashboards for school-wide insights.
